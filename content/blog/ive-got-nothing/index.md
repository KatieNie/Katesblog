I love podcasts. They fill my quiet chores or workout sessions with fascinating or comforting conversation and and often with new perspectives. The funny thing about podcasts is that they seem just pop out of thin air, and you think,
"oooh, something new", but no, they have been around for 5 or 7 years, you just didn't know about them. And the great thing, 
is that now you have this trove of new old things to listen too. This is also especially fun when you are exploring, again, or for the first time
a space that you haven't "visited" or know little to nothing about. 

Authors, whose job it is to learn about areas they know less or nothing about in the name of research for a novel
they want to write, wow, what a gig. This sounds like a delicious excuse to fall/dig yourself a rabbit hole of new knowledge and experiences. 

To get back to the podcast, my recent listen featured some guests talking about creativity. As a student, at some point
my engineering ambitions, and I guess natural aptitudes decided that my creative side was less important and somehow I felt that if I didn't embrace the more technical, detailed side of things that I'd miss
out on opportunities. Chris Noessel coined a similar notion as "socialization against creativity." The fact that creativity is hugely important for engineering, and not just artists, just feels so right. We are paid
to use our skills and be creative to utilize our knowledge to find solutions. 

So we should doodle, and draw, and actually work on the ways to backfill our creativity rather than shut it out, shut it down, or feel like you
aren't creative just because well, you weren't the best artist or didn't feel like you fit into a certain mold of who should be what.
