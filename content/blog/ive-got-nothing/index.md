I love podcasts. They fill my quiet chores or workout sessions with fascinating or comforting conversation, and often with new perspectives. The funny thing about podcasts is that they seem just pop out of thin air, and you think,
"oooh, something new!" But no, they have been around for 5 or 7 years, you just didn't know about them. And the great thing 
is that now you have this trove of new old things to which you can listen. This is also especially fun when you are exploring, again, or for the first time,
a space that you haven't perhaps completely incorporated. 

Authors, whose job it is to learn about areas they know less or nothing about in the name of research for a novel
they want to write - wow, great gig. This sounds like a dangerously fun excuse to fall or dig yourself a rabbit hole of new and old knowledge. 

To get back to the podcast, my recent listen featured some guests talking about creativity. As a student in school, at some point
my engineering ambitions, and I guess the evidence of natural aptitudes, made me push aside my creative tendencies as less important aspects and somehow felt that if I didn't embrace the
 more technical, detailed side of things that I'd miss
out on opportunities. Chris Noessel related a similar notion in a podcast as "socialization against creativity." The fact that creativity is hugely important for engineering, 
and not just artists, just feels so right when I look at the big picture. We are paid
to use our skills and be creative to utilize our knowledge to find solutions. We cannot say "I've got nothing."

So we should doodle, and draw, and actually work on the ways to backfill our creativity rather than shut it out, shut it down, or feel like we
aren't creative just because you were told there is only one answer or you weren't the best artist or you didn't feel like you fit into a certain mold of who should be what.
